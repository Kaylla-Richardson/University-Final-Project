# University-Final-Project
Final Project for DSBA 5122

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to show users the Top Universities in the World based on stats and allow them to compare Universities to each other. 

## Data Design
The data was prepared by 

## Streamlit App
A Streamlit app was made alongside this Github repository in order to provide a faster way to access the dataset and its contents. The link to the Streamlit App can be found [here](https://kaylla-richardson-university-final-project-college-vzkpbi.streamlit.app/).

## Tableau
A visualization of the data was created suing Tableau prior to this Github repository and the Streamlit app. The link to the Tableau Public Dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kaylla.richardson/viz/DSBA5122DataProject-WorldUniversity2/Story1).

## Future Work
To improve the app, in the future I want to improve the users interactability with the app. One feature I'd like to add is allowing users to filter the Universities based on location. 

## Data Source
The data source for the University data was "World University Rankings 2022-23" which was taken from data.world. The original dataset is derived from cwur.org. Around 19,788 institutions were ranked and this dataset is the top 2000. The dataset contains the institution, location, and various ranking scores.
